# htm

## How To Use:

* Any python files should be put in src; This allows you to 
access code from across different python files, e.g. if one
person has useful code in their file that you want to use, you 
can import it.

* Ideally unless you are working on the same thing, 
you should work in different python files. This will make life
a lot easier with git.

* To run the application as a whole, you should use the main.py
file. (of course if you want to test small parts of it, you can
make your own scripts)

* An example object has been made for creating GUI windows 
(HelloWorld), when making your own try and copy what that
class does.

* gl :)
